    <p><em>
        I've been passionate about football since I was a little kid. After a certain age, however,
        <br>you also start to be interested in other sports. After discovering a passion for basketball, I played basketball for a while. However, this sport
        could not prevail against football.<br>
        I also started repairing computers when I was a small child. At that time I opened my first own computer again and again and installed something new.<br>As I got older, 
        I kept wanting to learn computer languages, but I never knew how and where to start. After another while that was uselessly wasted,
        I accidentally came across Masterschool and am now learning JavaScript, HTML & CSS here. I really enjoy the course and I hope to pass it and one day actually get a job as a web developer.
