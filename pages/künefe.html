    <p>When I arrived, the first thing I looked for was a nice place to eat something nice.
        <br>Since I already knew my way around from my previous vacations, this made it easier for me to find a suitable place.
        <p></p>I really like Künefe it's very cute. The first time I ate kuenefe I was still a child.
        <br>Since these days I am very fond of this dessert. Kunefe is best eaten warm, with an ice cream
        <br> or kaymak (a kind of cream) together with a glass of Turkish tea (preferably without sugar, since the sugar content of Künefe is already sufficient) you can best enjoy this dessert. What, of course, should not be missing under any circumstances are pestachios. They give the dessert another special flavor.
        <p></p>        
        So I sat there and ate my kuefe with great pleasure and there my first family member came, which happened to be walking past the shop.
        <br>Since I hadn't told anyone that I was going on vacation, nobody knew anything about it, and that's why my family member was very surprised when he saw me sitting there.
        In any case, he came to me and sat down at my table. We ate our Künefe together and talked about the time we didn't see each other.
