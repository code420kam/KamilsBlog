        I was visiting a small restaurant that day and was delighted to find out that they had Adana Kebab there. 
        As an absolute meat lover, you cannot avoid trying this dish.
        <br>The taste buds in the mouth are stimulated very finely with the certain sharpness. What should not be missing with the meal is the drink, 
        which is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_water">"Salgam"</a>.
        <br>A further website explains what exactly it is. The drink has its very own taste and bears no resemblance to other typical drinks such as Cola,
         Fanta or Sprite and is one of the absolute favorites when eating an Adana skewer.
         <p>A dish that is confusingly similar to the Adana Kebab but is less well known is the Urfa Kebab. The main difference lies in the spiciness and flavor. 
        While the Adana kebab is spicy and heavily seasoned, the Urfa kebab is less seasoned and has no spiciness.</p>
        <br>However, after my remaining family members entered the country individually, we all met at this small local restaurant and had dinner together,
         developing interesting conversations and filling our stomachs with very good food.
         <p>As reported above, the main drink at Adana Kebab is actually salgam, but not everyone likes this drink. Alternatively, you can also be satisfied with a fresh Ayran.
          Ayran is the Turkish national drink, which is made from yoghurt and milk and is mostly known worldwide.</p>
